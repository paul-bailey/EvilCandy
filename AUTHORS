This branch of the project was derived from a private repo of mine.
While all of the code is mine, some inspirations include:

* Herbert Schildt's "Little C" interpreter, from where I learned about
  recursive-descent parsers.

* *The Unix Programming Environment*, by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike,
  which has a wonderful chapter on the development of programming
  languages in general.
