Bugs/Must-Do
------------

* Use autoconf, automake & cet., not just a hand-written Makefile

* Get rid of the by-reference policy on strings, it's probably not
  improving speed any but it's a nightmare to disclaim in Tutorial.txt.

* Start adding in test scaffolding where possible.

* Support exceptions.  Don't just throw an error and call exit().

* Support stdin; don't require a file name arg

* Support interactive mode

* Support serialization to byte-code files

* Support the continue statement

* Figure out how to deal with duplicate or cyclic loads.  It can't just
  be a cache of path names, because the same path can be expressed in
  different ways.

* Fix the cyclic-reference problem in GC.

Library/Language Features
-------------------------

* Add a Matrix/DSP module

* Support regular expressions

* Support complex numbers.

* Add debug module, make frames/code objects visible to user

* Add ability to disassemble during execution time

* Add stdin and shell environment to Io module

Mebbe/Wishlist
--------------

* Add "foreach" loop that resembles Python's "for" loop; this would be
  an alternative to the .foreach built-in method.

* Support use of newline to substitute for semicolon (BIG LIFT).

* Assembler.c is the "we have an AST at home" version of an abstract
  syntax tree.  Rewrite it from the ground up.

* Support a switch statement.  Even though it'll be no faster than
  an if-else-if block, switch statements are easier to read and
  therefore less buggy.

* Figure out how to de-chaos-ify and elegantize multiple inheritance
  without having to add a 'class' syntax.
