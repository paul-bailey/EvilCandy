Bugs
----

* BUGs 4/2025:

        * All user-visible data types need a .cpmz method.

Must Do
-------

* Integers are too recessive now; we need a way to int-ify a float
  without using a slow built-in function.

* ``this`` keyword barely tested; it will probably break a lot of
  stuff that seems to work without it.

* Start adding in test scaffolding where possible.

* Figure out how to deal with duplicate or cyclic loads.  It can't just
  be a cache of path names, because the same path can be expressed in
  different ways.

* Fix the cyclic-reference problem in GC.

Library/Language Features
-------------------------

* Support array slicing

* Add sets

* Add union operator for dicts

* Support soft keywords

* Support complex numbers.

* Add a Matrix/DSP module, something like NumPy for Python

* ^^ also add Tensor module, why not?

* Support regular expressions

* Add debug module, make frames/code objects visible to user

* Add stdin and shell environment to Io module

Mebbe/Wishlist/Low-prio bugs
----------------------------

* Change to struct block_t when adding try/catch renders a lot of the
  breakto/continueto argument passing in assemble.c unnecessary.  Get
  rid of all that and clean it up.

* Replace setjmp in assemble.c with normal stack unwinding.  May need
  to replace EOF with OC_EOF so that a <0 check will always mean
  'error'.

* Add way to mark current location while parsing, so that token.c and
  main.c aren't making their own separate and different error splashes.

* To cast an int to a float, user has to do something like
  ``x = 1.0 * x``.  Add something like ``float(x)`` and ``int(x)``
  instead.  Make these be keywords/instructions instead of built-in
  functions, to keep it fast.

* vm.c and types/function.c, as well as the structs they manipulate
  (vmframe_t, function_handle_t, executable_t) are very tangled up
  and require awkward back-and-forth calls between the two source
  files, esp. function_prep_frame and function_call.

* Replace jmp_buf in token.c with either fussier management of helper
  functions' return values, or with a big damn get_tok function.

* At assemble_eval() time, determine if certain expressions can be
  reduced to single consts known at assemble time.  Currently something
  like "1 + 2" will result in an operation at execution time instead
  of being compiled to just "3".  Big lift, basically means creating
  a parse tree BEFORE generating code.  We're currently doing these
  two tasks simultaneously.

* Preserve token buffer in interactive mode so that the UP arrow will
  recall previous expressions.

* String data type encodes Unicode in utf-8, which is compact, but it
  makes for slower processing.  Instead do something like cpython, which
  has an array data-width variable in its meta-data.  C-string
  termination still works, so long as the right uint*_t type is used
  when checking for a value of zero.
