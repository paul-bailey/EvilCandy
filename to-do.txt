* Support exceptions.  Don't just throw an error and call exit().

* Support stdin; don't require a file name arg

* Support interactive mode

* Support serialization to byte-code files

* Assembler.c is the "we have an AST at home" version of an abstract
  syntax tree.  Rewrite it from the ground up.

* Supprt the continue statement

* Support a switch statement.  Even though it'll be no faster than
  an if-else-if block, switch statements are easier to read and
  therefore less buggy.

* Figure out how to deal with duplicate or cyclic loads.  It can't just
  be a cache of path names, because the same path can be expressed the
  same way.

* Support imaginary numbers
