==================
EvilCandy tutorial
==================

.. admonition:: Update May 2025

   EvilCandy is still unstable, both its implementation and its
   specification.  As for this tutorial, about a third of it is true
   right now, another third of it was true before but no longer, and
   still another third is yet to be true.

.. note::

   If you're reading the raw version of this document, you may notice
   that it uses the syntax highlighting for JavaScript everywhere.  This
   is because I have not yet written a whole new syntax highlighting
   theme for Pygments, nor am I sure it's even possible for it to work
   for you if I do.  But this is *cosmetic*.  EvilCandy and JavaScript
   have *fundamentally incompatible* differences, which this document
   should clear up.
