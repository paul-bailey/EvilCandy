# tools/instructions
#
# These is the instruction set for EvilCandy.  gen.c parses
# this file and generates certain tables and other C definitions
# in order to prevent mistakes in the source files.
#
# Only one instruction per line.  Instructions have the same
# rules as C variable names, except that letters should be all
# upper-case.
#
# These get put into the .code field of instruction_t (see
# inc/instruction.h).  Each instruction also takes two arguments,
# making the total instruction word 32 bits.

# No operations, used in assemble_post as a placeholder before
# shifting opcodes down in the array while optimizing.
NOP

# Push NullVar onto stack ('null' as seen by the user).  In most
# cases, this stack position is the home of a new declared variable.
PUSH_LOCAL

# Load a variable or const and push it onto the stack.
LOAD_CONST
LOAD

# pop last item off the stack and consume its reference.
POP

# Save stack position and descend into a program flow loop.
# This is needed because the stack position is uncertain if
# a 'break' occurs.
PUSH_BLOCK
POP_BLOCK

BREAK
CONTINUE

# Pop top of stack and store its value in a declared variable.
#     - arg2 is an offset index
#     - arg1 tells what arg2 is an offset of: frame pointer,
#       .rodata, etc.
ASSIGN

# Like assign, but specifically for the global symbol table.
# arg2 is an offset from base of .rodata telling where
# the string name of the symbol is.
NEW_GLOBAL

# pop top of stack and return its value
RETURN_VALUE

# call function, of course.
# arg2 is the number arguments that have been passed.
# The stack is, from top:
#       arg_n
#       ...
#       arg_0
#       function
CALL_FUNC

# create a user-function variable and push it on the stack.
# Stack top is the struct executable_t to use for the new function.
DEFFUNC

# usually exists shortly after DEFFUNC.  Some evaluation has
# occured and placed an item on the stack, and now this
# instruction follows, meaning 'pop item off the stack,
# pop function off the stack', and add this closure to
# the function.  The assembler has sorted out the proper
# order to place such instructions as well as how the function
# when called can de-reference them
ADD_CLOSURE

# arg1 is IARG_FUNC_xxx, arg2 is a count, such as minimum
# number of args for function.  Function is on the top of the
# stack.
FUNC_SETATTR

# Pop arg2 # of args off the stack and make a list out of them
# (the top stack item is the (arg2-1)-th item in the list),
# then push the list back onto the stack.
DEFLIST

# Create a new dictionary, arg2 has #of key/value pairs on the
# stack waiting to be added to it.
DEFDICT

# like DEFLIST... but in tuple form!
DEFTUPLE

# Check if stack top is the correct type, then wrap it in a StarType
DEFSTAR

##
#   GET/SET/LOAD/DELATTR
#
# GETATTR pops the key and containing object off the stack, and pushes
# requested item onto the stack.
#
# SETATTR pops the item (the 'attribute') off the stack, pops the key off
# the tack, pops the soon-to-be-containing object off the stack, inserts
# the item into the containing object.  Nothing is pushed back on.
#
# LOADATTR is like GETATTR, except that it keeps the parent object and
# key on the stack, pushing the item on top of it.  It's for cases where
# item is both an operand and a target of assignment, eg. '+='

##
#   'for' loop stuff
#
# These are used for the Python-like for loop.  The C/JavaScript-like
# for loops are built with more primitive instructions.
#
# FOREACH_SETUP checks if the top item on the stack contains a sequential
# object.  If it is, do nothing.  If not and it's a dictionary, replace
# it on the stack with the dictionary's key list.  If neither, raise an
# error.
#
# FOREACH_ITER is the iterative step.  The stack is...
#    i           <- internal-use, invisible to user
#    haystack    <- the 'o' of 'for (k, o) {...}'
#    needle      <- the 'k' of ^^^
# If i matches or exceeds haystack's size, jump to the offset in arg2.
# If not, replace needle with ith haystack item, increment i, and
# carry on to the next instruction.
FOREACH_SETUP
FOREACH_ITER

# format an f-string.  Stack top is a string and below that is a
# tuple containing the args.
FORMAT

# Stack top should have either a tuple, integer, or string.
THROW

# The usu. branching instructions.  arg2. is (signed) how far to branch.
# since arg2 is 16 bits, instruction may only jump forward 32767
# instructions and backward -32768 instructions.  If that's not enough,
# users should learn how to write functions.
B_IF
B

# The usu. unary operators.  None of these are in-place.  Replace
# variable on stack with a new variable that is the result of the
# operation.
BITWISE_NOT
NEGATE
LOGICAL_NOT

# The usu. stack-machine binary operators.  Pop 'a' off the stack,
# then pop 'b' off the stack, perform 'c = a OPERATOR b' and push
# c onto the stack.
MUL
POW
DIV
MOD
ADD
SUB
LSHIFT
RSHIFT

BINARY_AND
BINARY_OR
BINARY_XOR
LOGICAL_OR
LOGICAL_AND

# Scripts don't always return a value, so END means 'quit this code
# block.'  It's an artifact, since assembler should be inserting
# PUSH and RETURN_VALUE in place of this
